# Bash Battle Arena: Master Bash Scripting Through Fun and Challenges

The **Bash Battle Arena** is a command-line game aimed at helping learners improve and enhance their Bash scripting abilities through an engaging and interactive experience. Players face a series of progressively challenging tasks that require them to write Bash scripts to solve. Each task is designed like a game level, allowing players to advance while mastering new Bash concepts and techniques.

# Objective:

Players are tasked with completing various "missions" 🛠️ using Bash scripts, which range from basic file manipulations 📁 to more advanced system operations 🖥️. The goal is to "conquer" each level 🎮 by successfully solving the challenge, with the ultimate aim of becoming a "Bash Master" 🏆.

# Game Structure

The game is structured in levels, starting at Level 1, with the difficulty increasing as you advance through each stage. Every 5 levels, you face a Boss Battle 💥 designed to challenge and reinforce the skills and knowledge you've gained from the previous levels.

# Repo Structure

This repository includes 15 levels, each paired with its respective solution. While solutions are provided, it's strongly encouraged to solve each challenge independently before referring to the solutions. This approach will maximize your learning and help you develop strong Bash scripting skills.
