ls -tp | grep -v '/$' | tail -n +6 | xargs -r rm --


# The solution uses 'ls -tp', where the -t flag sorts files by modification time, and -p adds a / to directories. When paired this with grep -v '/$', it filters out directories so that only files are selected.
# Next, tail -n +6 is used to skip the first 5 lines, so it lists just the older files to target. The xargs -r rm -- command is used to handle file deletion in one go, reducing the process overhead. The -r flag makes sure rm isnâ€™t called if there are no files to delete.
