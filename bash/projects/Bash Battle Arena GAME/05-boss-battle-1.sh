# The solution checks if the "Battlefield" directory exists. If not, it creates the directory and three text files (knight.txt, sorcerer.txt, and rogue.txt).
# If knight.txt exists in the "Battlefield" directory, we check if the "Archive" directory exists. If not, it creates it.
# The knight.txt file is then moved to the "Archive" directory.
# The script loops through both the "Battlefield" and "Archive" directories, printing out the names of the files they contain.
